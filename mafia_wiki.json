If you are killed, you will never play the game again. \nThe exact algorithm used to decide whether a kill attempt is successfull or not is kept a secret Some of the data points kill contract takes into consideration: User rank User wealth User Kill skill User family status User Bodyguard setup User Weapons User accomodation User bullet amount Killing requirements: Target is not in safehouse Target is not under 7 day protection Target is found in city You are in same city as target Target rank is within -5 and +3 ranks of your own rank. The process of killing another wallet. Find the user with detectives Travel to same city as your target Decide on amount of bullets to fire. Optional message to victim Decide if kill is anonymous or not Confirm the kill attempt. Possible results:\n\nYou successfully killed your enemy, and survived yourself.\nYou successfully killed your enemy, but you also died in their backfire\nYou failed to kill your enemy, and you survived as well.\nYou failed to kill your enemy, and you died in their backfire\n\nNote: When you fail to kill, you will have made significant damage on the users health points. \nIf you wait out the cooldown period, and try again, you will most likely be successfull unless your target has purchased new health points from the Hospital Why would someone want to kill another user? Most often it's driven by economic incentives. Example: If a low ranked user is running around with a large stack of currency on hand..They would be a target for other players, as they can earn currency by killing you. As a bonus they also earn rank points and kill skill at the same time. If you have a lot of cash on hand, and you are not protected by a family, you will most like get killed quite quickly. Watch out! Family inside kills & take-over If a family member kills his/her Don, while being an active member of the family, then the killer will automatically resume the Don position of the Family. This is called a Inside-kill or a family take over.\n\nIf the Consigliere or the Capodecina is quick to act, they can revenge the deceased Don and take the family back. But they need to kill him before someone from the outside does. This feature ensures that all family structures are kept under tight control where trust in each member becomes an essential cornerstone of the family \n\nIf an unwanted player resumes the Don position, the player can remove all top positions including successors. Then the new don can transfer out the entire family bank, and personal assets on the account . Now when the account gets finally killed, the family dies with the account. The family has no player to go to, as no positions are filled by the current Don. Trying your luck at the Don? The Don is a powerful position to have, and it is not easy to kill a Don. You will need to have a very powerful and co-operated attack to have a chance of success. You might end up swimming with the fishes before you know it.\n\nSpies and double agents exist, if they infiltrate your family, you might have a bigger problem than you might think.

Note : You will NOT risk your $MAFIA tokens by staking them Note : All active stakes at game launch will receive accumulated bullet reward To help the family bank earn currency, members can decide to stake a portion of their $MAFIA tokens towards the family bank. You can only stake towards the family which you are currently a member of.\n\nA stake generates an instant 1 to 1 currency mint in the family bank. Creating a family stake 1 $MAFIA  =  1$ Family Bank in-game currency All stakes are compounded 0.5% daily until game launch. Staking example: Create 1,000,000 $MAFIA stake.\nFamily  Bank receives 1,000,000 $Currency instantly. After 30 days   =   $1,167,207 in family bank After 90 days   =   $1,582,873 in family bank After 180 days   =   $2,503,953 in family bank After 365 days   =   $6,174,568 in family bank Why would you stake ? - To increase the worth valuation of your family.\n- To increase your families available currency upon game launch\n- Family members would normally be required to stake if they want to enjoy the protection\n- To get a $BULLET airdrop from game start How to unstake ? Unstaking becomes available prior to the deployment of Map update Based on how much land you own, you will be able to unstake your $MAFIA tokens weekly.\nIf you don't own any land, you can still unstake 5,000 MAFIA every week.\n\nIf you want to increase your unstaking amounts. You will need to acquire land tiles. \n1 tile = 20,000 $MAFIA weekly. Examples: Land tiles owned Unstake amount Every 0 5,000 $MAFIA 7 days 1 20,000 $MAFIA 7 days 5 100,000 $MAFIA 7 days 25 500,000 $MAFIA 7 days Note* You might want to consider borrowing map tiles from fellow mobsters during end stakes, to increase your weekly unstake amount How does family bank unstake work? There are two types of unstaking scenarios: The entire stake can be ended within a 7-day iteration. A portion of the stake can be ended within a 7-day iteration. When you choose to end only a portion of the stake, you are effectively ending the entire stake but re-staking the remaining amount. This impacts the yield. All yield from stakes is already accounted for in the family bank. However, ending a stake removes it from contributing further in-game cash currency to the family bank. Family stake bullet rewards The amount of bullets awarded to stakers remains hidden during the pre-launch phase. If you exit a stake, you lose all accumulated bullets from that stake. Only stakes that are active at the game’s launch will be rewarded with the accumulated bullets. Last updated 2 months ago Family end stake UI"

Last updated 4 months ago What are Notification Credits? Notification credits are automated bots that monitor the blockchain and send you alerts. Whether you're sleeping, on vacation, or simply unavailable, you can still receive important notifications when they matter most. Customize Your Own Alerts You can choose which on-chain actions are important to you. We offer a range of predefined actions to select from, and you can customize where you'd like to receive notifications—onsite, via SMS, or email. What Problem Do They Solve? Players invest significant time and effort into their accounts. During critical moments, such as family wars, every minute counts, and receiving a timely notification could mean the difference between success or failure. While advanced blockchain users can set up automated scripts to monitor the chain and configure similar services themselves, this puts the average player at a disadvantage. Although we can't prevent this, we can level the playing field by equipping legitimate players with the same functionality. Example: Notification trigger Credit cost Attack on me 📩 10 Attack on family member 📩 5 Family member killed 📩 6 You are dead 📩 1 You killed someone  (Backfire) 📩 8 Family Vault suspension 📩 1 Vault payout summary 📩 1 How do i buy 📩 Notification credits You can purchase Notification credits with BNB/PLS. The protocol will sell credit packages with: \n\n5 Notifications\n25 Notifications\n100 Notifications\n\n1 Key = 5 Notification credits Important disclaimer: Notification services do not offer any guarantees. Receiving a notification should be considered fortunate. The functionality of these notifications cannot be held responsible for any in-game actions."

The Exchange The Exchange. The only point of capital entry and exit to the game. Note: All values are subject to change If you need to deposit assets to the game, you go to the Exchange office.\nAs a part of this phase. Liquidity pools for both $BULLETS and $HEALTH will become available The Exchange  will work as multiple things: 1.  Deposit asset's to the game\n2. Withdraw asset's from the game\n2. Convert items to in-game currency\n3. OTC Desk for p2p trading\n4. Key purchase with volume bonus Withdraw example: Asset withdraw Fee Token receive 💵 In-game Currency 0% fee ⚫ $MAFIA Note: All fee's will get burned. Adding to the deflationary mechanics of these assets. Exchange conversion: Are you in a rush? Are you willing to take any deal? \n\nThe protocol is always willing to give you an offer on your items. The Exchange man will take in your items and give you cash for it. But look out, it might not always be the best deal. Conversion example: Input Fee Output offer: Remington 0% $12,532 💵 In-game Currency Lvl 10 - Frank 0% $1,623,523 💵 In-game Currency The Exchange officer, knows all the prices of all purchasable assets. He wants to turn a profit for himself. He was well trained by the tax man.\n\nThe Exchange officer doesn't care about how much time you put in ranking up a bodyguard, nor does he care about the rarity or utility of an item, such as a $500,000 Car.  If you spent $10,000,000 and 20 days on ranking up a bodyguard, the Exchange officer will only look at your out of pocket expense, and give you a offer based on that.\n\nThis is exactly the same for Cars and other assets. \n\n✅ Stage complete Last updated 1 month ago"

Watch out, other families might take advantage of this, and suspend your payout by attacking certain critical users How Does a Family Vault Suspension Happen? A vault suspension occurs when the number of family members exceeds the available capacity determined by the Family HQ size. Family HQ Capacity: Family HQ : Provides 5 member spots. Each connected tile : Adds 3 additional member spots. How to Increase Connected Tiles: To expand your connected tiles, you can: Claim land tiles using land crates. Purchase tiles directly from the marketplace. Seek OTC (over-the-counter) deals for specific tiles you need. Strategic Tiles: Losing control of strategic tiles is the most common cause of vault suspension. Family HQs have a single connected path of 3–5 tiles (depending on the city). Losing any of these tiles breaks the chain and can push the family into vault suspension. Losing an Important Tile: If an enemy attacks and captures a strategic tile, it can directly cause vault suspension. When this happens, the enemy family receives the entire vault payout during the suspension. This is a way for opponents to steal a family’s vault payouts. When a Family Enters Vault Suspension: Self-Caused Suspension : All vault payouts are equally distributed among other families that are not suspended. Enemy-Caused Suspension : The enemy family that caused the suspension takes the entire vault payout. Check out HQ Size page for more information ⏳ Information coming soon Last updated 1 month ago"

It's not required to have family+ status to be invited to an allegiance, only to create one. How vault sharing works inside allegiances: Allegiance member Share rate Total payout: Family A 10% 0% Family B 0% 5% Family C 0% 5% Family revenue in-game currency sharing: Allegiance member Share rate Total payout: Family A 0% 20% Family B 10% 0% Family C 10% 0% Note: You can only receive what other partners decide to share. \n\nWhen a family outside the top 8 paid positions become successful member of an Allegiances with active vault sharing. They now start earning direct income from the vault through allegiance sharing.\n\nAllegiances allows for larger families to benefit from working together with lower ranked families.\nLower ranked families can offer services and stake in their families revenue in exchange for direct vault access.\n\nThe Allegiance feature can  also be used to setup a pact or a protection fee system Allegiance protection IMPORTANT All gangsters who are in the same location as their family HQ have an increased defensive/offensive value.  \n\nWith Allegiances this increased defensive/offensive value will now extend to all cities of which allegiances partners are headquartered. \n\nThis allows family members to travel around without losing powers.

See Creating a family What is defense power ? Defense power is the amount of defensive power added to your character by owning that tile and its developments. Attacking someone in a city, where they have immense defense power through assets is a tough task. Gangsters cant be at home at all times, you might want to plan your attack when your enemy is travelling or out of town. What is $MAFIA Requirement ? Each building stage requires a certain amount of staked $MAFIA token to operate. \nYou can think of this as an operating cost. The $MAFIA stake can be ended at any time, and you can reclaim 100% of your $MAFIA from the building. When the building is not in operation, all defense powers and yielding are inactive. What's the cost of upgrading ? To upgrade your tile, you spend 💵 in-game currency.  This is a one-time deflationary fee, that you won't get back. Can i lose my tiles and buildings ? Yes. When you are killed, your tile resets to default, and it's now claimable again. \nThis creates a deflationary impact on assets inside the protocol. How does my buildings work together with other assets ? Having ownership of tiles in combination with each other, and in close proximity to your family HQ, will greatly improve your defense powers.  There are multiple booster features that adds extra defense to your tile.  See Connectors and HQ Size Early preview of the map update.

Key information: - The owner of this business item, owns it in ALL cities. It's a protocol wide ownership. Extremely lucrative. \n\n- This business item has no risk to the owner, it's a player versus player service where the owner gets a guaranteed fee. This item can only be lost through killing or transfer\n\n- The owner can run away with the entire lottery purse at any time they see fit.  But that might be dangerous.  Think twice before doing so. Game specifications: - Lottery draw every 72 hours.\n- Protocol mints initial deposits. Prize distribution: - 1st Place gets all cash spent to purchase tickets.\n- 2nd Place gets bullets  (Protocol inflation)\n- 3rd Place gets a car  (Protocol inflation)\n\n\nAs a twist, the protocol always owns 15-20% of the tickets. Meaning the lottery purse can roll over and grow extremely large."

Make sure you and your members own the right tiles. Last updated 1 month ago Having connected tiles is very powerful. At the same time, it will also be your weakness.\n\nConnectors are relevant for both Family HQ size, but also for worth/defense values of any user owned tile. Tile position affects Connectors greatly The maximum amount of connectors a single tile can have is 8. This is if your tile is placed in the middle of nothing.\n\nWhen a tile is surrounded by protocol owned assets, this number is reduced. An example would be a user tile that is placed at a road corner. This tile now only has 3 maxium connector tiles.\n\nThese 3 tiles are now just as powerful as if you had 8. Simply because its a measurement of total percentage available tiles to connect. \n\nIn other words, the less connector tiles you have, the easier it is to get to 100% connector coverage. The effect of this mechanic is that all tiles which are closer to the road/water/nature will naturally be more valuable, as you need to spend less effort to achieve high worth and defense values.\n\nThis is an example of the most desireable tile location as it only has 1 possible connector, which gives you the same benefit as a tile with 8 connectors as its seen as \"100% coverage\" Why is this also a weakness? Imagine you have a single string of tiles that connect to your Family HQ. Like a snake.\n\nIf your enemy target the tile closest to your Family HQ, and kills the owner. Your family will lose not only that connector tile, but the HQ Size attributes of EVERY OTHER TILE, that was connected through that specific tile. Effectively putting your family into vault suspension. How does Allegiance affect connectors ? - For all regular user ownable tiles, any allegiance owned tile DOES count as a successful connector. \n- For Family HQ and for Businesses, allegiance owned tiles does NOT count as connectors ⏳ More information coming soon Highly desired tile position with only 1 possible connector tile"

Last updated 6 months ago What is helpers? Helpers are small automated robots that perform actions for you. If you are sleeping, on vacation or simply not available to rank up your character, you can hire helpers to do the hard work for you. What problem do they solve? Mafia ranks are given based on performed actions on the ranking contract. These actions can be performed at a certain time interval. \n\nAdvanced blockchain users will be able to host automated scripts to optimise their ranking. Essentially performing a crime or action on the exact available time 24/7/365 \n\nThis means legitimate human players will get out-ranked and out-played by automated bots. We can't stop this, but we can equip legitimate players with the same functionality to even out the playing field. Example: Crime every 5 min.\nCar jacking every 15 min.\nSmuggling every 30 min.\nBullet purchase every 60 min.\nTravel every 60 min. \n\nObviously no human will be able to perform these actions on their exact availability around the clock, but doing so will propel you to the higher ranks quicker. How do i buy helpers? You can purchase helper credits with BNB/PLS. The protocol will sell credit packages with: \n\n1,000 Actions  \n5,000 Actions \n50,000 Actions\n\nYou can then assign Helpers to any of the crimes you want..  You will earn both currency and rank points just as if you performed these actions yourself. Same RNG and cooldowns.\n\nHelper bots can only help you with perfoming rank based actions. Helper bots will not have any say in attacking or defending any scenario. Important note: By using helpers, you avoid confirming transactions on every single rank building action. You will save a significant amount of $BNB/PLS fees\n\n50% of purchase fee goes directly to the vault.\n50% of purchase fee goes to the MAFIA team wallet to cover expenses for:\n\n1.  Server and domain expenses\n2. Game maintenance & development\n3. Support and moderation team\n\n\nN Make sure you have all the help you need."

In the Mafia protocol, each wallet has only one life. If you're killed, you can't return to the game. If your player profile holds multiple assets, here’s how they are distributed in the unfortunate event of your death. Note: All values are qualified, but not final. 🪙 Asset 🩸 Killer 📄Testimonial ⚫Protocol fee Pocket cash 100%🩸 0% 0% Bank cash 0% 50% 50% Bullets 0% 0% 100% Health 0% 0% 100% Cars 50%🩸 50% 0% Bodyguards 0% 0% 100% Helper credits 0% 50% 50% Noti credits 0% 50% 50% Business item 100%🩸 0% 0% Game OG 100%🩸 0% 0% Game Key 100%🩸 0% 0% Land tiles 50% 🩸 0% 50% MAFIA item 100%🩸 0% 0% Shop items 0% 0% 100% Note: For land tiles. The killer gets the land, but the protocol takes a fee by reducing the tile development -3 stages. Mobsters splitting the loot Some of the data points kill contract takes into consideration: User rank User wealth User Kill skill User family status User Bodyguard setup User Weapons User accomodation User bullet amount Killing requirements: Target is not in safehouse Target is not under 7 day protection Target is found in city You are in same city as target Target rank is within -5 and +3 ranks of your own rank. The process of killing another wallet. Find the user with detectives Travel to same city as your target Decide on amount of bullets to fire. Optional message to victim Decide if kill is anonymous or not Confirm the kill attempt. Possible results:\n\nYou successfully killed your enemy, and survived yourself.\nYou successfully killed your enemy, but you also died in their backfire\nYou failed to kill your enemy, and you survived as well.\nYou failed to kill your enemy, and you died in their backfire\n\nNote: When you fail to kill, you will have made significant damage on the users health points. \nIf you wait out the cooldown period, and try again, you will most likely be successfull unless your target has purchased new health points from the Hospital Why would someone want to kill another user? Most often it's driven by economic incentives. Example: If a low ranked user is running around with a large stack of currency on hand..They would be a target for other players, as they can earn currency by killing you. As a bonus they also earn rank points and kill skill at the same time. If you have a lot of cash on hand, and you are not protected by a family, you will most like get killed quite quickly. Watch out! Family inside kills & take-over If a family member kills his/her Don, while being an active member of the family, then the killer will automatically resume the Don position of the Family. This is called a Inside-kill or a family take over.\n\nIf the Consigliere or the Capodecina is quick to act, they can revenge the deceased Don and take the family back. But they need to kill him before someone from the outside does. This feature ensures that all family structures are kept under tight control where trust in each member becomes an essential cornerstone of the family \n\nIf an unwanted player resumes the Don position, the player can remove all top positions including successors. Then the new don can transfer out the entire family bank, and personal assets on the account . Now when the account gets finally killed, the family dies with the account. The family has no player to go to, as no positions are filled by the current Don. Trying your luck at the Don? The Don is a powerful position to have, and it is not easy to kill a Don. You will need to have a very powerful and co-operated attack to have a chance of success. You might end up swimming with the fishes before you know it.\n\nSpies and double agents exist, if they infiltrate your family, you might have a bigger problem than you might think.

Last updated 4 months ago The protocol offers a buyback feature to facilitate frictionless play at a cost of exchange rates. Much like using a foreign tourist cash exchange. It's sometimes needed, but not optimal. Cash items convert directly 1:1 into liquid in-game cash. All items are burned inside the protocol upon conversion to in-game currency. Not all item types are supported such as Business items. This enables users to convert their inventory item's into 💵 in-game currency. More information coming soon.
